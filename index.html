<h1><strong><u>Anand Muthusamy</u></strong></h1>
    
<h2>Hello from Pasadena, CA!</h2>

<p>I think about life science, biotech, venture capital, & new scientific institutions. I enjoy all things sport and speed.</p>

<p>I'm currently leading a seedling organization for molecular measurements in humans as a Research Fellow at Convergent Research (<a href="https://www.convergentresearch.org/team">team profile</a>) and a Visiting Scientist at Caltech.
</p>

<p>I have lived on the three coasts of the U.S.: I was born and raised in Houston, TX, studied at Penn in Philadelphia, PA, worked at Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, VA, and did my PhD at Caltech in Pasadena, CA where I currently reside. I feel extremely lucky to have met incredible people in each of these communities who have helped shaped my path. If you're reading this: thank you.</p>

<p>My prior work has been in chemical biology, protein engineering, molecular neuroscience, and machine vision for animal behavior:

    <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16494/">PhD Thesis</a>
</p>

<p>I was honored with Caltech's Demetriades-Tsafka-Kokkalis Prize for this workâ€”you can

</p>

<p>I have talked about my work on a couple podcasts:
